# bio

Dr. Nicholas Tierney (PhD. Statistics, BPsySci (Honours)) is a Research
Fellow in Statistics at Monash University, working with Professors
Dianne Cook and Rob Hyndman. His research aims to improve data analysis
workflow. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to
accompany each research idea. Recent work has focussed on exploring data
with the R package visdat, and on creating analysis principles and tools
to simplify working with, exploring, and modelling missing data with the
package naniar. Nick has experience working with decision trees,
optimisation, Bayesian Data Analysis, and MCMC diagnostics.

Nick is a member of the rOpenSci collective, which works to make science
open using R, has been the lead organiser for the rOpenSci ozunconf
events from 2016-2018, and co-hosts the rstats podcast “Credibly
Curious” with Dr. Saskia Freytag. Outside of research, Nick likes to
hike, rockclimb, bake sourdough, knit hats, and explore new hobbies.
