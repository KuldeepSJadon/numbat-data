# Sharing data?

.large[
Plenty of research that tells you it is important to share data

And that data sharing should be FAIR (findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)

But these don't actually tell you how to do share data
]

---

# Why not share data?

.large[
There are indeed good reasons to not share data:

1. Privacy concerns (e.g., human subjects, locations of critically endangered species)

1. May put the authors at a competitive disadvantage ( but data can be embargoed for reasonable periods of time)
]

---

# Why not share data?

.large[
"If you can't do something right, don't do it"

- This ^^ is wrong - you **can** provide something, even if it is just simulated data.

- Sharing data (in most cases) has a net positive benefit
]

---

# How to think about sharing data

.large[

It can feel like a wall or a mountain we need to climb. 

These require special tools and knowledge.

It should instead be an "on-ramp"

**This talk should hopefully get you started**

- Dataset(s) in the form used in analysis.
- e.g., data used in a linear regression.
- Ideally, it would be "tidy data" form.
- Plain-text format, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.txt`
- Binary / proprietary formats are discouraged, since they require special software (although these can go into a `data-raw` file - to be discussed)
- e.g., don't use `.rda`, `.rds`, `.sav`, `.dta`, `.sas7bdat`.

- Guides the reader/user to how to understand this directory.
- Handy when there are no reliable standards
- Top level of the data repository, (optionally for each dataset)
- Contains the who, what, when, where, why, of your data.
- `.md` allows you to take advantage of markdown - making it easy to insert lists, tables, and links.

- Provides structure allowing data to be indexed and searched online, through services such as google datasets search using JSON-LD.
- To create appropriate metadata, we recommend metadata generators such as `dataspice` or `codebook`
- Metadata should be provided in a folder called "metadata", which should be provided for every dataset.

# Actually sharing the data

Now that you've created your data folder, you need to **get it somewhere online**

Two options I would like to discuss:

1. Putting the data online
1. Sharing as an R package


---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Online repositories: Zenodo & Dryad

---

# Zenodo

.large[
- Launched in 2013 in a joint collaboration between openAIRE and CERN
- Free, archival location to deposit datasets
- File size limit is 50gb for individual files
- Able to accommodate larger file sizes upon request
]

---

# Dryad

.large[
- The Dryad Digital Repository takes data from any field of research, and perform human quality control and assistance of the data
- Can link data with a journal publication, in exchange for a data publishing fee.
]

---

# Linking zenodo and GitHub

.large[

You can also link Zenodo with Github

Zenodo updates with new DOI at every "release" (Helps avoid managing many moving pieces)

See this article on github, [making your code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) (Thanks to [Arfon Smith](https://www.arfon.org/))
]

# Sharing data as an R package

.large[
"data only" R packages. (e.g., [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13), [`eechidna`](https://docs.ropensci.org/eechidna/), [other Australian datasets](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/OZdatasets/))
  ]
  
.pull-left.large[
Pros

- installable
- documentation
- share data cleaning
- great for R users
]

.pull-right.large[

Cons

- Size: ! >= 5Mb (CRAN)
- Doesn't help others outside R
]

---

# Sharing data as an R package

.medium[
- Most (but not all!) data shared as an R package, or with an R package is for teaching purposes
- Sharing the data together in this way allows you to create a "research compendium", where code + paper + computing environment + data is in one place.
- See more about this in Karthik Ram's talk: ["How To Make Your Data Analysis Notebooks More Reproducible"](https://github.com/karthik/rstudio2019)
- Note also that the suggested directory structure for sharing data is based off of an R package
]

---

# Online "data" journals

.large[
- Provides familiar mechanism for citation
- But journals don't yet have a good way to outline how to share data
- Often looks like a "mini paper" with the methods, and isn't always about the data, but about collection methods.
- Can link to a Zenodo or Dryad repository.
]

---

# Online "data" journals

.large[
Some example data journals:

- Nature: Scientific Data
- Data in Brief
- Data

]

---

# Take homes

.large[
- You don't have to do every single thing to publish your data
- Take small steps - get the data somewhere first, add more detail as you go
]

---

# Future Directions

.large[
- Currently working on a proposal for "datadevtools" - a set of developer tools to facilitate sharing data
- These tools can then be used to assess "shareability" of data
]
